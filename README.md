# üßæ SQL Sales Database Project
## üìä Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a sales database system using SQL.
It includes multiple related tables ‚Äî Customers, Products, Orders, and OrderDetails ‚Äî and explores how to use joins and aggregate functions to analyze and retrieve data.

The goal is to understand data relationships and perform real-world database operations like calculating total revenue, linking customers to their orders, and practicing inner, left, right, and full joins.

## üß† Objective

To design a mini relational database and perform SQL operations to:

Create and link multiple tables using Primary and Foreign Keys

Perform JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)

Calculate total revenue generated from customer orders

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
Tool	Purpose
SQL Server / MySQL	Database creation and query execution

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Structure
##üßç Customer Table

Stores basic customer details.

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Customer VALUES
(1, 'Priya Desai', 'Mumbai'),
(2, 'Rohan Joshi', 'Pune'),
(3, 'Vidhak Joshi', 'Dhule');

## üíª Products Table

Contains product information and pricing.

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Products VALUES
(10, 'Laptop', 50000.00),
(11, 'Mouse', 500.00),
(12, 'Headphones', 1500.00);

## üì¶ Orders Table

Links customers to their purchase orders.

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id)
);

INSERT INTO Orders VALUES
(100, 1, '2025-07-15'),
(101, 2, '2025-07-16');

## üßæ OrderDetails Table

Connects orders to products and quantities.

CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
    detail_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);

INSERT INTO OrderDetails VALUES
(1, 100, 10, 1),
(2, 100, 11, 2),
(3, 101, 12, 1);

## üîç SQL Queries & Operations
1. View all tables
SELECT * FROM Customer;
SELECT * FROM Products;
SELECT * FROM Orders;
SELECT * FROM OrderDetails;

2. Calculate total revenue per order
SELECT 
    (OrderDetails.quantity * Products.price) AS total_revenue,
    Products.name,
    Products.price,
    OrderDetails.order_id,
    OrderDetails.quantity
FROM OrderDetails
LEFT JOIN Products 
ON Products.product_id = OrderDetails.product_id;

3. Calculate total overall revenue
SELECT SUM(OrderDetails.quantity * Products.price) AS total_revenue
FROM OrderDetails
LEFT JOIN Products 
ON Products.product_id = OrderDetails.product_id;

4. INNER JOIN
SELECT * 
FROM Customer
INNER JOIN Products 
ON Products.name = Customer.name;

5. LEFT JOIN
SELECT * 
FROM Customer
LEFT JOIN Orders 
ON Orders.customer_id = Customer.customer_id;

6. RIGHT JOIN
SELECT * 
FROM Products
RIGHT JOIN Customer 
ON Products.name = Customer.name;

7. FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT * 
FROM Products
FULL OUTER JOIN Customer 
ON Products.name = Customer.name;

## üìà Output Insights

The project calculates total revenue per product and per order.

Demonstrates the use of all types of SQL joins.

Shows the relationship between customers, orders, and products in a structured manner.
